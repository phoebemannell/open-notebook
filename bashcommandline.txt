Bash Command Line and Counting and Mining Research Data with Unix

This probably should have been tutorial #1. Oh my god my life would have been so much easier if I had learned these things systematically at an earlier point. I know Shawn has already stated that he meant to have this earlier in the lesson plan, but it is definitely a necessary opening lesson for those planning on working in digital history. 

Using terminal is like crafting a custom cabinet. It would be easier and faster to go to IKEA, buying a dresser, and assembling it in an afternoon, but if you built your own from scratch, it would end up being custom-built for your needs, would be stronger and last longer, and is probably a better product. But if you mess up assembling an IKEA dresser, worst case scenario you've wasted a few hundred dollars and an afternoon. If you mess up working on your custom cabinet, you've wasted tons of time, materials, and you're definitley extremely frustrated. But there are also workarounds when you mess it up, and you can replace a piece rather than replacing an entire piece of furniture which is necessary when your IKEA dresser inevitably crumbles into its constituent pulp.
